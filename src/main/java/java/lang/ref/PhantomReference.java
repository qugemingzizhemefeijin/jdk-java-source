/**
 * Phantom reference objects, which are enqueued after the collector
 * determines that their referents may otherwise be reclaimed.  Phantom
 * references are most often used for scheduling pre-mortem cleanup actions in
 * a more flexible way than is possible with the Java finalization mechanism.
 *
 * <p> If the garbage collector determines at a certain point in time that the
 * referent of a phantom reference is <a
 * href="package-summary.html#reachability">phantom reachable</a>, then at that
 * time or at some later time it will enqueue the reference.
 *
 * <p> In order to ensure that a reclaimable object remains so, the referent of
 * a phantom reference may not be retrieved: The <code>get</code> method of a
 * phantom reference always returns <code>null</code>.
 *
 * <p> Unlike soft and weak references, phantom references are not
 * automatically cleared by the garbage collector as they are enqueued.  An
 * object that is reachable via phantom references will remain so until all
 * such references are cleared or themselves become unreachable.<br>
 * <br>
 * 虚引用也被称为幽灵引用，它是最弱的一种引用关系。一个对象是否有虚引用的存在，完全不会对其生存时间构成影响，也无法通过虚引用来取得一个对象实例。<br>
 * 也就是说，通过其 get() 方法得到的对象永远是null。<br>
 * <br>
 * 注意：虚引用不会被垃圾收集主动解除 referent 引用关系，会导致OOM，要么引用无法被访问，要么手动进行clear。上面的英文注释也说的很明白。<br>
