/**
 * Weak reference objects, which do not prevent their referents from being
 * made finalizable, finalized, and then reclaimed.  Weak references are most
 * often used to implement canonicalizing mappings.
 *
 * <p> Suppose that the garbage collector determines at a certain point in time
 * that an object is <a href="package-summary.html#reachability">weakly
 * reachable</a>.  At that time it will atomically clear all weak references to
 * that object and all weak references to any other weakly-reachable objects
 * from which that object is reachable through a chain of strong and soft
 * references.  At the same time it will declare all of the formerly
 * weakly-reachable objects to be finalizable.  At the same time or at some
 * later time it will enqueue those newly-cleared weak references that are
 * registered with reference queues.<br>
 * <br>
 * 弱引用的强度比软引用更弱一些，当垃圾收集器工作时，无论当前内存是否足够，都会回收掉只被弱引用关联的对象。<br>
 * 它一般用于维护一种非强制的映射关系，如果获取的对象还在，就是用它，否则就重新实例化，因此，很多缓存框架均基于它来实现。<br>
